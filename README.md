# TechTrade

TechTrade was developed in January 2025 for WPI's annual Goathacks Hackathon. The goal of this project was to create a platform for WPI Students to buy and sell their belongings. Inspired by Facebook Marketplace, the team wanted a place to sell their unwanted WPI related belongings, such as textbooks, toolkits, school supplies and more.

In the future we would want to implement chat functionality so that people can communicate within the platform instead of contacting them through an email. Verify users are WPI students by using their WPI email, instead of just asking for ID.
